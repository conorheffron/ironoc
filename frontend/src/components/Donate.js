                   essential proteins that bind the skin's layers together, so any minor friction, movement or trauma causes it to break, tear, and blister. 
                   It is as fragile as a butterfly wing. That's why we're here. To be a positive force for all those living with EB and all whose lives have been impacted by EB.`,
